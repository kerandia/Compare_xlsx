Excel File Comparison Script Documentation

This script compares two Excel files (file1.xlsx and file2.xlsx) and identifies whether the values in the first column of each row are equal or not. It uses the openpyxl library to read and load the Excel files and then compares the values row by row. The result is a list indicating whether each row's values in the first column are the same or different between the two files.

Function: compare_excel_files(file1, file2)

Compares two Excel files and identifies whether the values in the first column of each row are equal or not.

Parameters:

    file1 (str): The path to the first Excel file (file1.xlsx).
    file2 (str): The path to the second Excel file (file2.xlsx).

Returns:

    result (list): A list containing strings indicating whether each row's values in the first column are the same or different between the two files.

Example Usage:

python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file1 = "file1.xlsx"
    file2 = "file2.xlsx"

    result = compare_excel_files(file1, file2)
    print(result)

Explanation:

    The script imports the openpyxl library, which allows reading and writing Excel files.

    The compare_excel_files function is defined, taking file1 and file2 as input arguments.

    Inside the function, the two Excel files are loaded using openpyxl.load_workbook() into workbook1 and workbook2.

    The active sheet (first sheet) of each workbook is retrieved using the .active attribute, and rows from the sheets are extracted using .rows.

    The script initializes a counter variable to keep track of the row number being compared and an empty result list to store the comparison results.

    The function iterates through the rows of both sheets simultaneously using zip() and compares the values in the first column of each row (cell A) using row1[0].value and row2[0].value.

    If the values in the first columns are equal, the function appends "Yes, rowX" (where X is the row number) to the result list.

    If the values in the first columns are not equal, the function appends "No, row X" to the result list.

    After comparing all the rows, the function returns the result list.

    In the if __name__ == "__main__": block, the script specifies the file paths for file1 and file2.

    The compare_excel_files() function is called with these file paths, and the results are stored in the result variable.

    The script then prints the result list, showing whether each row's values in the first column are the same or different between the two files.

This documentation provides an overview of the Excel file comparison script and how it compares the values in the first column of each row between two Excel files. The result is a list indicating whether each row's values are the same or different.
